// As a devops engineer, I want microservices for deploying it into the application and to make sure how it works.
_MICROSERVICES_ +

-> Microservices will break the applications into distinct services, which can be developed and deployed independently. +
-> For this microservices the communication between the services will done through API gateway. With this we can develop easily, update seamless and manage each service without application failure. +
-> Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features. +

We need cloud platform, for building or deploying the microservices application.
Eg: Containerization(Dockers)
Hospital management application has divided into 4 services

     * Patient registration


      * Clinical patient


      * Bed management


      * Claim management +

_Monolythic Vs Microservices:_ +

-> With monolithic architectures, all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service. +
-> Monolithic architectures add risk for application availability because many dependent and tightly coupled processes increase the impact of a single process failure. +
-> With a microservices architecture, an application is built as independent components that run each application process as a service. +
-> Because they are independently run, each service can be updated, deployed, and scaled to meet demand for specific functions of an application. +
