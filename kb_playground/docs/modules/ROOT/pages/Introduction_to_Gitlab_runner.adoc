Gitlab server +
Gitlab runner. +

* The gitlab server offers interface, creates and manages the repository needed for the project. +
* TheGitlab runner is the tool for executing the commands defined in the job and stores the output as a artifacts. +

_Why Gitlab?_ +
* A tool for CI/CD pipelines. +
* simple and scalable architecture. +
* Pipeline as a code +
* Issue tracking is possible +
* market share is growing continuously. +

_What is CI/ CD?_ +

====
*CI [Continuous Integration]:* +
It is an automation process for developers. +
Successful CI means new code changes to an app are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository. +
It’s a solution to the problem of having too many branches of an app in development at once that might conflict with each other. +
====
====
*CD [Continuous Delivery/Deployment]:* +
Continuous delivery usually means a developer’s changes to an application are automatically bug tested and uploaded to a repository (like GitHub or a container registry), where they can then be deployed to a live production environment by the operations team. +
Continuous deployment (the other possible "CD") can refer to automatically releasing a developer’s changes from the repository to production, where it is usable by customers. +

*_Pipeline basic concepts_* +

-> Pipelines are the top-level component of continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.

-> Pipelines comprise:

       * Jobs, which define what to do. For example, jobs that compile or test code.
       * Stages, which define when to run the jobs. For example, stages that run tests after stages that compile the code.

-> Jobs are executed by runners. Multiple jobs in the same stage are executed in parallel, if there are enough concurrent runners.

-> If all jobs in a stage succeed, the pipeline moves on to the next stage.

-> If any job in a stage fails, the next stage is not (usually) executed and the pipeline ends early.

-> In general, pipelines are executed automatically and require no intervention once created. However, there are also times when you can manually interact with a pipeline.

-> A typical pipeline might consist of four stages, executed in the following order:

* A build stage, with a job called compile.
* A test stage, with two jobs called test1 and test2.
* A staging stage, with a job called deploy-to-stage.
* A production stage, with a job called deploy-to-prod.
